EnergySP: Call for Papers

Cybersecurity and privacy are an important pillar of energy systems. Modernized energy systems, including smart grid, distributed/renewable energy resources, EV-charging infrastructure, smart homes, and smart buildings, have been facing a number of cybersecurity attacks. On the other hand, extensive data collection from such systems are calling for stronger privacy protection.

ACM SIGEnergy Workshop on Cybersecurity and Privacy of Energy Systems (EnergySP) aims to establish an open forum for novel research ideas exchanged and shared  from the smart energy community in the context of cybersecurity and privacy. We aim to bring together diverse experts from the cybersecurity and privacy aspects as well as from those from the energy sector to establish cross-disciplinary exchanges of knowledge and insights to tackle the critical challenges in securing our energy future and providing privacy assurance to energy applications.

We encourage researchers and experts in the field of cybersecurity energy systems to take the opportunity to use this workshop to share their work and open the discussion of new ideas on this evolving topic.  

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

-Cryptographical solutions, secure key management, authentication, provenance, and access control for smart energy systems
-Cybersecurity of distributed energy resources and IoT devices
-Security analysis of energy management systems and grid controlling systems 
-Industry standardization of secure energy management and control protocols
-Detection, prevention, and mitigation of cyber attacks and system anomalies in smart energy systems
-Cloud/Edge security for smart energy systems
-Machine/Deep learning and artificial intelligence approaches for security and privacy in smart energy systems
-Threat intelligence collection and analysis for smart energy systems
-Deception technologies for smart energy systems
-Moving target defense for smart energy systems
-Digital twins and testbeds for security and privacy risk assessment of smart energy systems
-SCADA and legacy system security
-Security by design and verification tools for smart energy systems
-Cyber attack and defense case studies on smart energy systems
-Human factors aspects in cybersecurity and privacy in smart energy systems
-Privacy-preserving energy systems and applications
-Privacy protection of energy data collection and sharing
-Blockchain-based secure energy systems 

Submission format: 
Papers, 4-6 pages in 9-point ACM double-column format (i.e., excluding references) and unlimited number of pages for appendices and references.
